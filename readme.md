# ðŸŒŠ Flow Checkout Script

Script needs the GTM web container ID of the client it's used for. Currently I have APLs hardcoded.

From my understanding, we are to provide flow a URL for this script for each of our clients.

The script is mostly functioning but needs some questions answered, marked as TODO.

I'm using a Simo template for cookie retrieval. That script will need to be installed along with this for proper functioning. Details

The data objects for each step of the checkout are included in case you get bored
