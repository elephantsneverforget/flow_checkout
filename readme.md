# Flow Checkout Script

Script needs the GTM web container ID of the client it's used for.

From my understanding, we are to provide flow a URL for this script for each of our clients.

This is mostly functioning but needs some questions answered, marked as TODO.

I'm using a Simo template for cookie retrieval. That script will need to be installed along with this for proper functioning. Details
